Points to consider:
- Hotel admin and customer accounts are also doable Here

-Room Availability Calendar: Implement a visual calendar that shows the availability of rooms for a given month. 
    Users can view the availability of rooms on specific dates and make bookings accordingly.

-Room Upgrades: Allow customers to upgrade their room category during the check-in process. 
    Display the price difference between the current and upgraded room categories, and update the receipt accordingly.

-Guest Feedback: Allow customers to provide feedback and ratings about their stay after checking out. Implement a feedback system where customers can rate different aspects of their experience, such as cleanliness, service, and facilities.

-Booking Modifications: Enable customers to modify their bookings, such as changing the check-in/check-out dates, 
    adding or removing guests, or updating special requests. Validate and apply the modifications, and update 
    the booking details accordingly.
